# 2023cord
A theme for Discord that brings the 2023 UI back

###### Profile effects, profile colors, emoji panel, pings, avatar decorations, general layout, color scheme, and banners should appear as they did in mid 2023.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> - Enable "Sync Profile Themes" in `Settings > Accessibility` to fix broken profile colors
> - UI Density should be on default, i wont support the other 2 options (they still kinda work though)
> - To have the old gray colors, use the "Ash" theme in appearance settings
